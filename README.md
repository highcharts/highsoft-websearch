Highsoft Search
===============

The search system consists of a client component and an offshelf component. A
server only needs to provide the client component access to the keyword files,
that were created by the offshelf component. Therefor neither a database nor a
server script is needed, which makes the search system compatible to any cloud
storage with web browser access.
